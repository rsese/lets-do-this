## Let's Do This

Let's Do This is a collaborative task list for people who work together.  Only
basic functionality is implemented right now, but it's still pretty useful.
Everyone's individual task list is displayed on the home page, anyone can add
tasks to anyone else's task list, and tasks can be given to other users.
Thanks to JQuery, tasks can be drag and drop reordered and edited in place.

## Thanks Buddy

The user authentication code and the Pages controller is taken completely from
Michael Hartl's extra-dope [Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/).
